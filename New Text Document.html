    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the <strong>TO DO LIST</strong> app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by <strong>Orbital devs</strong> (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Ad Supported service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

    <strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>
    <p>The Application utilizes third-party services that automatically collect information to function, provide advertisements, and analyze performance. This information may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (IP address) used for approximate location estimation.</li>
        <li>Device identifiers (such as Android Advertising ID).</li>
        <li>App activity (such as app launches, taps, and ad views).</li>
        <li>Diagnostic data (such as crash logs and performance metrics).</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Third-Party Services</strong>
    <p>The Application uses third-party services that have their own Privacy Policies. Below are the links to the providers used:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en" target="_blank">AdMob</a></li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Data Security & Encryption</strong>
    <p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. All data collected by the third-party SDKs (like AdMob) is <strong>encrypted in transit</strong> using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to ensure it remains secure while being transmitted to servers.</p>

    <strong>Location Information</strong>
    <p>The Application does not collect precise GPS location data. It may use your IP address to determine <strong>approximate</strong> geographical location to serve relevant local advertisements through our ad partners.</p>

    <strong>Opt-Out Rights</strong>
    <p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may also opt-out of interest-based advertising through your Android device settings (Settings > Google > Ads).</p>

    <strong>Children</strong>
    <p>The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If a parent becomes aware that a child has provided us with information, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

    <strong>Changes</strong>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. You are advised to consult this page regularly for any changes.</p>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2026-02-18</p>
